# Mastering Python - Lessons 041 to 046
# Topic: Control Flow, Conditions, and Membership in Python
# This code covers key concepts from Lessons 41 to 46 of the "Mastering Python" course by Elzero Web School:
# - Lesson 041: Using if, elif, and else for decisions
# - Lesson 042: Nested if statements for complex conditions
# - Lesson 043: Short if (ternary) conditions
# - Lesson 044: Practical if training with user choice
# - Lesson 045: Membership operators (in, not in)
# - Lesson 046: Practical membership control example

# Lesson 041 - If, Elif, Else
# Basic conditional statements for decision-making
