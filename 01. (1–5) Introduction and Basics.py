# Mastering Python - Lessons 001 to 005
# Topic: Introduction to Python, Syntax, Comments, and Basic Data Types
# This code covers the core concepts from Lessons 1 to 5 of the "Mastering Python" course by Elzero Web School:
# - Lesson 001: Introduction to Python and its importance
# - Lesson 002: What you need to learn Python (tools and setup)
# - Lesson 003: Basic syntax and writing your first app
# - Lesson 004: Using comments to document code
# - Lesson 005: Introduction to basic data types in Python

# Lesson 001 - Introduction And What's Python
# Python is a versatile, easy-to-learn programming language used for web development, data analysis, AI, and more.

# Lesson 002 - What I Need To Learn?
# To learn Python, you need:
# 1. Python installed (download from python.org)
# 2. An IDE or editor (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)
# 3. Practice and patience!
print("What I Need To Learn Python:")
print("1. Install Python from python.org")
print("2. Use an IDE like VS Code or PyCharm")
print("3. Practice coding daily")

# Lesson 003 - Syntax And Your First App
# Python uses simple syntax: no semicolons, indentation matters!
# Let's create a basic app to say hello
name = "Mohamed"
print("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to your first Python app!")
print("Python syntax is simple and readable")
print("")
print("------------------------------------")
print("")

# Lesson 004 - Comments And How To Use It
# Comments explain code; single-line comments use '#'
# Multi-line comments (docstrings) use triple quotes
"""
I am excited to learn Python!
Use multi-line comments for documentation or notes.
"""
print("Comments help explain code")
print("# is for single-line comments")
print('""" or \'\'\' is for multi-line comments')
print("")
print("------------------------------------")
print("")

# Lesson 005 - Dealing With Data in Python
# Python has several basic data types
print("String:", "hello")  # String (str) - text data
print("Type of 'hello':", type("hello"))  # Check type with type()
print("Integer:", 10)  # Integer (int) - whole numbers
print("Type of 10:", type(10))  # Check type
print("Float:", 10.1)  # Float - decimal numbers
print("Type of 10.1:", type(10.1))  # Check type
print("")
print("------------------------------------")

print("1 - Learned about Python and its uses")
print("2 - Understood tools and setup needed for learning")
print("3 - Wrote a simple app with basic syntax")
print("4 - Used single-line and multi-line comments")
